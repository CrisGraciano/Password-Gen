# Password Generator Starter Code

I started the code to prompt the user to choose the criteria for their password.
Things I was able to get done:
    1. Prompted the user to choose a length from 8-128 characters
    2. If a non number character was entered or a number out of range, the user would be promted to enter a number again.
    3. After the number was entered, the length was saved as a variable. 
    4. After user entered number, prompt windows asking for the types of characters were shown and user would choose ok for true or cancel for false.
    5. Again, answers were saved as varibales.
    6. I made arrays containing the characters for each choice and saved them as variables.

I tried to use Charcodes to not use the arrays but that seemed to be more confusing. 
I got the arrays to print out on the generated password field but didnt realize how. I started the if statements but I was unsure of the loops for the arrays.
